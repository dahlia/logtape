LogTape changelog
=================

Version 1.1.1
-------------

To be released.

### @logtape/pretty

 -  Fixed a bug where logs with long property keys would cause the formatter to
    fail, resulting in no output being displayed.  The issue occurred when
    property keys exceeded the indentation width, causing negative padding
    calculations that threw a `RangeError`.  [[#87]]

[#87]: https://github.com/dahlia/logtape/issues/87


Version 1.1.0
-------------

Released on September 11, 2025.

### @logtape/logtape

 -  Added “fingers crossed” logging feature that buffers debug logs in memory
    and only outputs them when a trigger event occurs, reducing log noise while
    preserving context for debugging.  [[#59]]

    -  Added `fingersCrossed()` function that implements the fingers crossed
       logging pattern with support for trigger levels, buffer management, and
       category isolation.
    -  Added `FingersCrossedOptions` interface for configuring fingers crossed
       behavior with options for trigger level, buffer size, and category
       isolation modes.

 -  Added `Logger.emit()` method for emitting log records with custom fields,
    particularly useful for integrating external logs while preserving their
    original timestamps.  [[#78]]

### @logtape/file

 -  Changed `getStreamFileSink()` to implement `AsyncDisposable` instead of
    `Disposable`.

 -  Fixed flaky behavior in high-volume logging scenarios where some log records
    could be lost during sink disposal. The sink now ensures all data is fully
    written to disk before disposal completes.

### @logtape/pretty

 -  Added `PrettyFormatterOptions.properties` option for displaying
    `LogRecord.properties` (structured data).  [[#69], [#70] by Matthias Feist]

[#70]: https://github.com/dahlia/logtape/pull/70

### @logtape/sentry

 -  Changed the type of the `getSentrySink()` function to accept any Sentry
    client implementing the public capture APIs (was
    `(client?: Client) => Sink`). Introduced a structural `SentryClientLike`
    interface to avoid nominal type conflicts across differing `@sentry/core`
    instances. [[#80] by Sora Morimoto]

 -  Fixed preservation of Sentry template metadata by returning a
    `ParameterizedString` from the internal `getParameterizedString()` so that
    `captureMessage` receives the templated form and breadcrumbs/formatting can
    leverage `__sentry_template_*` metadata. [[#80] by Sora Morimoto]

 -  Fixed cross-runtime compatibility by removing an unnecessary `node:util`
    type import referenced only by documentation, avoiding module resolution
    issues outside Node.js. [[#80] by Sora Morimoto]

Version 1.0.5
-------------

Released on September 10, 2025.

 -  The satellite packages (*@logtape/file*, *@logtape/otel*,
    *@logtape/redaction*, *@logtape/sentry*, and *@logtape/syslog*)
    now properly specify version compatibility constraints for their peer
    dependency on *@logtape/logtape*, ensuring consumers install compatible
    versions of the core package.


Version 1.0.4
-------------

Released on July 6, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where the optimized code paths in `getJsonLinesFormatter()`
    did not output newline characters between JSON objects, violating the
    JSON Lines specification. This completes the fix that was partially
    addressed in version 1.0.3.


Version 1.0.3
-------------

Released on July 6, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where `jsonLinesFormatter` and the formatter returned by
    `getJsonLinesFormatter()` did not output newline characters between
    JSON objects, violating the JSON Lines specification that requires
    one JSON object per line.


Version 1.0.2
-------------

Released on July 4, 2025.

 -  Fixed Vercel Edge Functions compatibility issue where LogTape caused Node.js
    API warnings due to `process.on` usage detection. Refactored process access
    to use type-safe `globalThis` casting instead of `@ts-ignore` directive.

[#67]: https://github.com/dahlia/logtape/pull/67


Version 1.0.1
-------------

Released on July 3, 2025.

 -  Fixed React Native compatibility issue in *@logtape/pretty* package where
    top-level Node.js imports caused build failures. Replaced direct `node:util`
    imports with platform-specific utilities using conditional module loading
    via *package.json* imports map.  [[#63]]

 -  Fixed compatibility issue with Cloudflare Workers where `process.on()` is
    not available, causing configuration to fail with `process.on is not a
    function` error. LogTape now checks for `process.on()` availability before
    attempting to register exit handlers.  [[#64], [#65] by Martin Petrovsky]

Version 1.0.0
-------------

Released on June 22, 2025.

 -  Added `getLogLevels()` function to retrieve all available log levels.

 -  Added `LogMethod` type for better type inference of logger methods.

 -  Added `nonBlocking` option to `getConsoleSink()`, `getStreamSink()`,
    `getFileSink()`, and `getRotatingFileSink()` for high-performance logging
    scenarios. When enabled, log records are buffered and flushed in the
    background, preventing blocking of the main thread.

     -  Console and stream sinks accept `nonBlocking?: boolean | {
        bufferSize?: number; flushInterval?: number }` option.
     -  File sinks accept `nonBlocking?: boolean` option.
     -  Default buffer size is 100 records for console/stream sinks and
        background flushing for file sinks.
     -  Default flush interval is 100ms for console/stream sinks.
     -  Console sink returns `Sink & Disposable` in non-blocking mode.
     -  Stream and file sinks return `Sink & AsyncDisposable` in non-blocking mode.
     -  Buffer-full flushes are now asynchronous (non-blocking) instead of
        synchronous to maintain performance during high-volume logging.
     -  Console and stream sinks include automatic buffer overflow protection
        that prevents unbounded memory growth by dropping oldest records when
        buffer exceeds 2x the configured size.
     -  Errors during background flushing are silently ignored to prevent
        application disruption.

 -  Added `getStreamFileSink()` function in *@logtape/file* package for
    high-performance file logging using Node.js PassThrough streams.

     -  Added `StreamFileSinkOptions` interface for configuring stream-based
        file sink behavior.
     -  Uses PassThrough streams piped to WriteStreams for optimal I/O performance
        with automatic backpressure management and non-blocking writes.
     -  Optimized for high-volume logging scenarios with superior throughput
        compared to standard file sinks.
     -  Simple configuration with `highWaterMark` (default: 16384 bytes) and
        optional custom `formatter` options.
     -  Automatic stream cleanup and proper resource disposal via `Disposable`
        interface.
     -  Ideal for production applications requiring high-performance file logging
        without complex buffering configuration.


 -  Added `fromAsyncSink()` function to convert async sinks to regular sinks
    with proper async handling.

     -  Added `AsyncSink` type: `(record: LogRecord) => Promise<void>`.
     -  `fromAsyncSink()` chains async operations to ensure order preservation.
     -  Errors in async sinks are caught to prevent breaking the promise chain.
     -  Returns a sink with `AsyncDisposable` support that waits for all
        pending operations on disposal.

 -  Added *@logtape/cloudwatch-logs* package for AWS CloudWatch Logs
    integration. [[#48], [#49]]

     -  Added `getCloudWatchLogsSink()` function to send logs to AWS CloudWatch
        Logs.
     -  Added `CloudWatchLogsSinkOptions` interface for configuration.
     -  Supports intelligent batching up to 10,000 events or 1MiB per batch.
     -  Includes exponential backoff retry strategy for error handling.
     -  Works with existing CloudWatch Logs clients or creates new ones
        automatically.
     -  Supports custom AWS credentials and regions.
     -  Added `formatter` option to support custom text formatters, including
        `jsonLinesFormatter()` for enhanced CloudWatch Logs Insights querying
        capabilities with dot notation support.

 -  Added *@logtape/windows-eventlog* package for Windows Event Log
    integration. [[#47], [#50]]

     -  Added `getWindowsEventLogSink()` function to send logs to Windows Event
        Log.
     -  Added `WindowsEventLogSinkOptions` interface for configuration.
     -  Cross-runtime support: Works with Deno, Node.js, and Bun on Windows.
     -  Uses runtime-optimized FFI implementations: Deno FFI, koffi for Node.js,
        and Bun FFI for maximum performance.
     -  Supports all LogTape log levels with proper Event Log type mapping
        (Error, Warning, Information).
     -  Includes structured logging support with formatted context information.
     -  Added `validateWindowsPlatform()` function for platform validation.
     -  Added `WindowsPlatformError` and `WindowsEventLogError` for proper error
        handling.
     -  Platform-restricted installation (Windows only) for safety.
     -  Includes PowerShell-based test verification for actual Event Log
        integration.

 -  Added *@logtape/pretty* package for beautiful console formatting designed
    for local development. [[#46], [#51]]

     -  Added `getPrettyFormatter()` function to create visually appealing log
        formatters with colorful icons, smart category truncation, and perfect
        column alignment.
     -  Added `prettyFormatter` constant for quick setup with sensible defaults.
     -  Added `PrettyFormatterOptions` interface for extensive customization.
     -  Features Signale-inspired design with emojis for each log level:
        🔍 trace, 🐛 debug, ✨ info, ⚠️ warning, ❌ error, 💀 fatal.
     -  Includes smart category truncation that preserves important context
        while maintaining layout (e.g., `app·server…middleware`).
     -  Supports true color terminals with rich color schemes and dimmed text
        for enhanced readability.
     -  Provides optional timestamp display, custom icons, color control, and
        flexible layout options.
     -  Supports multiple text styles combination (e.g., `["bold", "underline"]`)
        for level, category, message, and timestamp formatting.
     -  Includes word wrapping feature with proper indentation alignment
        to maintain visual consistency for long messages.
     -  Optimized for development environments with focus on visual clarity
        and developer experience.

 -  Added *@logtape/adaptor-pino* package for integrating LogTape with Pino
    logging infrastructure.  [[#52]]

     -  Added `getPinoSink()` function to forward LogTape log records to Pino
        loggers.
     -  Added `PinoSinkOptions` interface for configuring the adapter behavior.
     -  Added `CategoryOptions` interface for customizing category formatting in
        Pino log messages.
     -  Added `install()` function for convenient auto-configuration with
        custom Pino logger and configuration options.
     -  Supports configurable category display with position (`start`/`end`),
        decorators (`[]`, `()`, `<>`, `{}`, `:`, `-`, `|`, `/`, or none), and
        custom separators for multi-part categories.
     -  Maps LogTape log levels to equivalent Pino levels.
     -  Preserves LogTape's structured logging properties as Pino fields.
     -  Enables seamless adoption of LogTape-enabled libraries in applications
        using Pino without requiring logging infrastructure changes.

 -  Added *@logtape/adaptor-winston* package for integrating LogTape with
    winston logging infrastructure.  [[#52]]

     -  Added `getWinstonSink()` function to forward LogTape log records to
        winston loggers.
     -  Added `WinstonSinkOptions` interface for configuring the adapter
        behavior.
     -  Added `CategoryOptions` interface for customizing category formatting in
        winston log messages.
     -  Added `install()` function for convenient auto-configuration with
        optional custom winston logger and configuration options.
     -  Added `install.ts` module for automatic setup via simple import.
     -  Supports configurable category display with position (`start`/`end`),
        decorators (`[]`, `()`, `<>`, `{}`, `:`, `-`, `|`, `/`, or none), and

Version 0.12.3
--------------

Released on September 10, 2025.

 -  The satellite packages (*@logtape/file*, *@logtape/otel*,
    *@logtape/redaction*, *@logtape/sentry*, and *@logtape/syslog*)
    now properly specify version compatibility constraints for their peer
    dependency on *@logtape/logtape*, ensuring consumers install compatible
    versions of the core package.


Version 0.12.2
--------------

Released on July 6, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where `jsonLinesFormatter` and the formatter returned by
    `getJsonLinesFormatter()` did not output newline characters between
    JSON objects, violating the JSON Lines specification that requires
    one JSON object per line.


Version 0.12.1
--------------

Released on June 19, 2025.

 -  Fixed module resolution issues in CommonJS environments and bundlers
    like Vite by properly configuring conditional exports for types.

     -  Updated all package.json exports to use conditional `types` exports with
        separate `.d.ts` files for ESM imports and `.d.cts` files for CommonJS
        requires.
     -  This resolves runtime errors in frameworks like SvelteKit that require
        proper CommonJS modules for modules imported in CommonJS contexts.


Version 0.12.0
--------------

Released on June 15, 2025.

 -  Added the `"trace"` severity level, which is lower than `"debug"`.  [[#24]]

     -  Added `"trace"` to the `LogLevel` union type.
     -  Added `Logger.trace()` method.

 -  Added `Logger.warning()` method which is an alias for `Logger.warn()`.
    [[#44]]

 -  Added `bufferSize` and `flushInterval` options to `FileSinkOptions` for
    configurable buffering in file sinks.

     -  `getFileSink()` and `getRotatingFileSink()` functions now accept a
        `bufferSize` option to control write buffering behavior.
     -  `getFileSink()` and `getRotatingFileSink()` functions now accept
        a `flushInterval` option to control the time-based flushing of
        the buffer to disk.
     -  When `bufferSize` is 0 or negative, writes are immediate without
        buffering.
     -  When `bufferSize` is positive, log entries are buffered until the
        buffer size is exceeded, then flushed to disk.
     -  Default buffer size is 8192 characters for improved performance.
     -  Buffer content is automatically flushed when the sink is disposed.
     -  When `flushInterval` is 0 or negative, the time-based flushing is
        disabled.
     -  Default `flushInterval` is 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) for
        periodic flushing.

 -  Added *@logtape/syslog* package for sending log messages to syslog servers
    using RFC 5424 format.

     -  Added `getSyslogSink()` function to create syslog sinks with support for
        both UDP and TCP protocols.
     -  Supports all standard RFC 5424 facilities (`kern`, `user`, `mail`,
        `daemon`, `local0`–`7`, etc.) and automatic priority calculation.
     -  Includes structured data support for log record properties with proper
        RFC 5424 escaping of special characters.
     -  Cross-runtime compatibility with Deno, Node.js, and Bun.
     -  Configurable connection timeouts, custom hostnames, and application
        names.

 -  Now *@logtape/otel*, *@logtape/sentry*, and *@logtape/syslog* packages are
    released along with *@logtape/logtape* package.  This means they share the
    same version number and changelog.  This is to ensure that the packages are
    always compatible with each other and to simplify the release process.

 -  Improved build and test infrastructure by migrating from [dnt] to [tsdown]
    for npm package bundling.  [[#43]]

Version 0.11.1
--------------

Released on July 6, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where `jsonLinesFormatter` and the formatter returned by
    `getJsonLinesFormatter()` did not output newline characters between
    JSON objects, violating the JSON Lines specification that requires
    one JSON object per line.


Version 0.11.0
--------------

Released on June 2, 2025.

 -  Loggers now allow to interpolate all properties at once through the special
    placeholder `{*}`.  This is useful for logging objects with many properties
    without having to specify each property name in the message template.

     -  `Logger.debug()`, `Logger.info()`, `Logger.warn()`, `Logger.error()`,
        and `Logger.fatal()` methods now accept a message template with the
        `{*}` placeholder.  Unless there is a property with the name `*`,
        the `{*}` placeholder will be replaced with a stringified version of
        the `LogRecord.properties` object.
     -  As a shorthand, overloads of `Logger.debug()`, `Logger.info()`,
        `Logger.warn()`, `Logger.error()`, and `Logger.fatal()` methods that
        accept an object as the first argument now treat the object as a
        message template with the `{*}` placeholder.  This is equivalent to
        calling the method with a message template of `{*}` and the object as
        the second argument.

 -  Added the built-in [JSON Lines] formatter.

     -  Added `jsonLinesFormatter()` function.
     -  Added `getJsonLinesFormatter()` function.
     -  Added `JsonLinesFormatterOptions` interface.

[JSON Lines]: https://jsonlines.org/


Version 0.10.0
--------------

Released on May 19, 2025.

 -  Added `@logtape/redaction` package for redacting sensitive information
    from log records.

     -  Added `redactByField()` function.
     -  Added `FieldPattern` type.
     -  Added `FieldPatterns` type.
     -  Added `FieldRedactionOptions` interface.
     -  Added `DEFAULT_REDACT_FIELDS` constant.
     -  Added `redactByPattern()` function.
     -  Added `RedactionPattern` interface.
     -  Added `RedactionPatterns` type.
     -  Added `CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER_PATTERN` constant.
     -  Added `EMAIL_ADDRESS_PATTERN` constant.
     -  Added `JWT_PATTERN` constant.
     -  Added `KR_RRN_PATTERN` constant.
     -  Added `US_SSN_PATTERN` constant.

 -  The text formatter now can omit the timestamp from the formatted message.
    [[#35] by Ooker]

     -  Changed the type of the `TextFormatterOptions.timestamp` option to
        `"date-time-timezone" | "date-time-tz" | "date-time" | "time-timezone"
        | "time-tz" | "time" | "date" | "rfc3339" | "none" | "disabled"
        | ((ts: number) => string | null)` (was `"date-time-timezone"
        | "date-time-tz" | "date-time" | "time-timezone" | "time-tz" | "time"
        | "date" | "rfc3339" | ((ts: number) => string)`).
     -  Changed the type of the `FormattedValues.timestamp` property to
        `string | null` (was `string`).

 -  Added `FileSinkOptions.lazy` option.  [[#38], [#39] by Rickey Ward]

 -  The `configure()` and `configureSync()` functions now check for duplicate
    logger configurations with the same category and throw a `ConfigError` when
    detected.  This prevents unintended overriding of logger configurations when
    configuring multiple loggers with the same category.  [[#41]]

Version 0.3.1
-------------

Released on May 7, 2024.

 -  Fixed a bug where two or more versions of LogTape were imported in the same
    runtime, the `Logger` instances would not be shared between them.  This was
    caused by the `Logger` instances being stored in a module-level variable.

Version 0.2.2
-------------

Released on April 21, 2024.

 -  Fixed a bug where the configured sinks and filters were reset after
    some inactivity.  This was caused by garbage collection of the
    `Logger` instances.  The `Logger` instances are now kept alive by
    an internal set of strong references until explicitly `reset()` is
    called.

-------------

Released on April 20, 2024.

 -  Removed `FileSinkDriver` interface.
 -  Added `RotatingFileSinkOptions` interface.

     -  The return type of `configure()` function became `Promise<void>`
        (was `void`).
     -  The return type of `reset()` function became `Promise<void>`
        (was `void`).
     -  Configured sinks that implement `AsyncDisposable` are now disposed
        of asynchronously when the configuration is reset or the program exits.

 -  The return type of `getStreamSink()` function became
    `Sink & AsyncDisposable` (was `Sink & Disposable`).

 -  Added `getRotatingFileSink()` function.
